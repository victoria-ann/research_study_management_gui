MVC architecture: Clean separation of database (Model), user interface (View), and program logic (Controller) for easy maintenance and scalability. <br>
<br>
Database connectivity: Connects to a relational SQL database (SQL schema/code provided) to store and retrieve study and participant data. <br>
<br>
Participant tracking: Researchers can add participants to studies and record demographic information. <br>
